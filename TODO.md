# TODO

- Support for forbidden error (this may be caused by some ddos/flood protection? because it may fail for the same id, that a while ago was working)
- Support confirming age on video
- Support for private video
- Support for video unavailable (e.g. account has been terminated, copyright grounds, removed by the uploader)
- Allow to configure location for places and process databases
- Store errors in process table
