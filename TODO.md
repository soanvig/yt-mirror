# TODO

- Support for forbidden error (this may be caused by some ddos/flood protection? because it may fail for the same id, that a while ago was working)
- Support confirming age on video
- Group outputs of different actors (by color maybe)
- Support for private video
- Support for video unavailable (e.g. account has been terminated, copyright grounds, removed by the uploader)
- Some actors disappear in the meantime?
- Add timestamp and actor id (this may be satisfied by actor color) to log
